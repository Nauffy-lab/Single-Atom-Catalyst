# Single-Atom-Catalyst
Worked with Prof. Steven L. Tait at Indiana University Bloomington as part of a three-month long internship.
The project involved the development of novel heterogeneous catalysts by leveraging on-surface metal-ligand coordination to stabilize single-atom catalysts (SACs) for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study focused on understanding surface reactions and the role of ligand interactions in optimizing catalytic performance. We synthesized and characterized the catalysts using advanced analytical techniques, including X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Electron Microscopy (EM), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) to gain insights into their structural and electronic properties. Additionally, we explored how electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) and electron-donating groups (EDG) influence catalytic activity and selectivity, demonstrating that ligand modifications can effectively tune electron density at the active site and control reaction pathways in PDH reactions.
